# Movie_Recommendation_System
The recommendation system you described is based on the concept of collaborative filtering, which assumes that if a user has a preference for one item (in this case, a movie or show), they are likely to have similar preferences for other similar items.
By analyzing attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, and other relevant features of movies, the recommendation system can identify patterns and similarities between different movies and make personalized suggestions.
